                Say that many couples enter a dance hall. Immediately afterwards, the people in each of the couples separate and mingle so that at a later time some people are alone and other people are paired up in possibly new couples. For this repairing, each person has the highest affinity to be with the person he or she originally came with and a lower affinity to be with anyone else, however, since each person has only one high-affinity partner, there is a greater likelihood for a person to find a lower-affinity partner. With these constraints, how can we determine the average number of people who are alone and the average number of people who are with their original partner at the later time?

                This combinatorial problem maps onto the problem of biomolecules (e.g., proteins, DNA) with promiscuous interactions. For the most part, biomolecule-biomolecule interactions within a cell are very specific with each biomolecule having a high affinity to its correct binding site or correct partner biomolecule. However, each biomolecule also often has a small affinity to other biomolecules, biomolecules that are usually so numerous that they can effectively compete with the high-affinity interaction. This work builds analytical models of these biomolecular interactions in order to understand the conditions under which the correct (i.e., high affinity) interactions dominate in protein-protein and protein-DNA systems. Ultimately, we find that self-assembly in these systems is most limited by the product between monomer diversity and volume.

                <i>The figure shows a problem solving process which takes into account the need to identify a need or inconstincency and develop a problem framework before the standard heuristics of problem-solving are applied. Physics courses usually give students practice in the final step. The first two steps constitute the missing curriculum.</i>

                Going through a physics course (not to mention an entire physics undergraduate curriculum) requires solving many problems. The main goal in tasking the student with so many problems is to develop a deeper knowledge of the principles underlying physical phenomena. A secondary goal—and a common reason for why physics majors are even for those who don't intend to become physicists—is that solving physics problems cultivates problem solving ability in general. In this paper I argue that the nature of the problems most commonly assigned makes this latter goal unlikely.

                Although materials scientists make extensive use of various kinds of glasses, physicists do not understand glasses as well as they understand other systems like ideal gases or crystalline solids. Consequently, in order to build some understanding of glassy systems, physicists construct models which bear some of the basic properties of glasses (like disorder) without the more precise structural properties (like varying randomized bonding in multiple dimensions) which make glasses difficult to analyze in general. In this category are <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_glass'>spin glasses</a> which consist of taking the interactions between spins on a lattice to be random. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This paper considers "permutation glasses" which are more abstract models of disorder consisting of a state space of <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation'>permutations</a> where the energies of each permutation are random much in the same way spin glass interaction energies are random. The main result of the model shows that this energy disorder can contribute to thermal disorder, thus making the system less tolerant of high temperatures. The results of this paper expand our understanding of how disorder affects to systems with many degrees of freedom and also how such disorder can be manifest in abstract physical systems.

                A well known problem in molecular biology concerns how sequences of amino acids are related to the 3D structure of the protein they form. The problem has two related manifestations: the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction'>protein folding problem</a>  which attempts to determine, given a sequence of amino acids, what particular three-dimensional structure results, and the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_design'>protein design problem</a> (also termed, the "inverse-folding problem") which seeks, given a particular three-dimensional structure, what amino acid sequences fold into that structure
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Some theoretical attempts to probe the protein design problem rely on a spin-lattice model of amino acids, but given the features of the problem it seems more appropriate to consider a state space of permutations rather than spins. With this motivation, the goal of the "Statistical Physics of the Symmetric Group" work was to explore the basic statistical physics of systems whose state spaces consisted of various permutations of an ordered list.

                The image on the left shows the decay process studied in my thesis. In this process, a pseudo-<a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstino'>goldstino </a> decays into a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton">gravitino</a> (the superpartner of the graviton) and a photon. The image on the right represents the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a> breaking scenario which leads to the particle spectrum (specifically, the gravitino and pseudo-goldstino) needed for the decay. The larger goal of the entire project was to develop a model of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a> which could be compared with then recent Fermi Telescope results <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2797"> (https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2797) </a>
